Broadly, the test manager will communicate with a simulated LOX valve (which performs nominally) and a real LOX valve by giving environmental configuration data from the environment space. The test manager will compare the behavior of the simulated LOX valve and the real LOX valve given the environmental configuration and use this information to produce a model of the risk/performance of the real LOX valve given several environmental parameters.
